# Sensor App README

This README provides essential information to get started with your Node.js application. Please follow the instructions below to set up and run the application.

## Installation

Before running the Node.js application, you need to install its dependencies. Make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system.

Use the following command to install the required packages:

```bash
npm install
```

This command will download and install all the necessary dependencies listed in the `package.json` file.

## Running the Application

To run the application, you need to execute two separate Node.js scripts: `app.js` and `sensorSimulator.js`. Here are the steps to run both of them:

### 1. Run `app.js`

Execute the following command to run the `app.js` script:

```bash
node app.js
```

This will start the main application, and you should see any output or logs generated by it.

### 2. Run `sensorSimulator.js`

In a new terminal or command prompt window, execute the following command to run the `sensorSimulator.js` script:

```bash
node sensorSimulator.js
```

This script may simulate sensor data or perform other tasks related to your application.

## Configuration

Before running your application, ensure that you have set the required environment variables. You can add these environment variables to a .env file in the root directory of your project. Here are the environment variables you should include in your .env file:

```bash
MONGODB_URI=mongodburl
PORT=3001
GMAIL_USER=emailAddress
GMAIL_PASSWORD="**************"
CELSIUS_THRESHOLD=30
HUMIDITY_THRESHOLD=80
MOCK_EMAIL=stratclientnotif8000@yopmail.com
```

# API Guide

This guide explains the API routes and their functionality for your Node.js application. The application uses the Express framework to create a RESTful API for managing sensor data. The data is stored in a MongoDB database using Mongoose.

## Endpoints

### 1. Create Sensor Data

- **Route:** POST `/`
- **Description:** Create and store new sensor data in the database.
- **Request Body:**
  - `location` (string): Location of the sensor data.
  - `temperatureCelsius` (number): Temperature in degrees Celsius.
  - `humidityPercent` (number): Humidity in percentage.
  - `pressureHpa` (number): Pressure in hPa.
- **Response:** The created sensor data object.

### 2. Get All Sensor Data

- **Route:** GET `/`
- **Description:** Retrieve all sensor data from the database.
- **Response:** An array of sensor data objects.

### 3. Get Sensor Data by ID

- **Route:** GET `/:id`
- **Description:** Retrieve sensor data by its unique ID.
- **Request Parameters:**
  - `id` (string): Unique ID of the sensor data.
- **Response:** The sensor data object.

### 4. Update Sensor Data by ID

- **Route:** PUT `/:id`
- **Description:** Update sensor data by its unique ID.
- **Request Parameters:**
  - `id` (string): Unique ID of the sensor data.
- **Request Body:** You can include one or more of the following fields to update:
  - `location` (string): New location.
  - `temperatureCelsius` (number): New temperature in degrees Celsius.
  - `humidityPercent` (number): New humidity in percentage.
  - `pressureHpa` (number): New pressure in hPa.
- **Response:** The updated sensor data object.

### 5. Delete Sensor Data by ID

- **Route:** DELETE `/:id`
- **Description:** Delete sensor data by its unique ID.
- **Request Parameters:**
  - `id` (string): Unique ID of the sensor data.
- **Response:** No content (HTTP 204 status).
